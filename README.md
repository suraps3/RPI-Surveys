RPI Surveyor

    It is always important to have a strong connection between Student Government and the actual students of a campus. 
    It eases accessability to education programs and opportunities around campus, as well as increasing the quality of education at an institute. 
    We all want to have the best possible experience at college.
    
    This is where RPI Surveyor comes in. 
    It is a platform/forum where students can post recent problems they have on campus, and where student government moderators and administrators can post surveys on possible solutions to the target problem. 
    Students can vote on problems from the forum they would like to be considered or discussed, and answer surveys to gather a general consensus for what feasible solution is largely preferred. 
    There will be a hierarchy within forum posts where students can either vote for or ignore them, and the most voted forum will appear at the top. 
    Forums will also have an expiry time (ex. three weeks).
